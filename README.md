# Real-Time Object Detection and Classification in Surveillance Imagery

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered surveillance system designed to accurately detect and classify aerial and naval objects in real-time. The project leverages the YOLOv8-seg deep learning model, optimized for low-latency and high-accuracy object detection in military and defense contexts. The system is intended to address challenges such as latency, lower accuracy, and limited capability to handle multiple targets simultaneously, ultimately improving mission success and reducing false positives and negatives.

## Problem Statement

The current surveillance systems in military and defense contexts face significant challenges in detecting and classifying aerial and naval objects over long distances in dynamic environments. These challenges include high latency, low accuracy, and limited multi-target handling capabilities. This project aims to enhance real-time processing, improve detection accuracy, and reduce reliance on human operators.
